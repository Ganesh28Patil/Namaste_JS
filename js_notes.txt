How JS code is Executed ?
It create a Global Execution Context, 
And allocates Memory to all the varaible & functions
even before a single line of code is executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------

"Let" & "Const" are introduced in ES6 of Javascript.

'Let' & 'Const' declarations are hoisted in JS. 
They are hoisted differently then 'Var'.
'Let' & 'Const' are in Temporal Dead zone for a time being.

Temporal Dead Zone : 
It is the time span since when this "Let" varaible is hoisted and till it is initialised with some value.
The time between that is known as Temporal dead zone.

Example : 
consle.log(a);  // it will get hoisted in SCRIPT instead of Global
                // Uncaught RefferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization.
let a = 10; // initalised and declaration

Whenever you tries to access the varaible in the Temporal dead zone it gives you an error (Refference error)


What is Block in JS.
Block is defined as { }
Block is also known compound statement.

{
    var a = 10;
    let b  = 20;
    const c  = 30;
}

In the above üëÜ senario  , 'b' & 'c' are in block scope and 'a' is in Global scope.
Block ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
b: undefined
c: undefined
Global ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
a: undefined

What is shadowing in JS ?

const c = 100;
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
    console.log('a:', a)  // 10
    console.log('b:', b)  // 20
    console.log('c:', c)  // 30
    // Here the value of C is shadowed (overwritten) for this perticular scope    
}
console.log('c:', c)  // 100

What is illigal-shadowing in JS ?
  while shadowing a variable, it should not cross the boundary of the scope, 
  i.e. we can shadow var variable by let variable but cannot do the opposite. 
  So, if we try to shadow let variable by var variable, it is known as Illegal Shadowing and 
  it will give the error as ‚Äúvariable is already defined.‚Äù

Example : 

let a = 20;
{
    var a = 50;
}

Here in this you will encounter an error,
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared.

let a = 20;
{
    let a = 60;
}

this will working under shadowing.

var a  = 20;
{
    let a = 30;
}

this will also work under shadowing.

const a  = 20;
{
    const a = 80;
}

this will also work under shadowing.

What is Closure ?

 Function bundled with its lexical scope is known as closure,
 Closure is a function bunddled together with its lexical environment
Or 
 Closure along with its lexical socpe bunddled together is known as closure.
 Function along with its lexical scope forms a closure.

A Closure is  the combination of a function bunddled together with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)

Exmaple üëâ

   function x(){
       var a = 7;
       function y(){
           console.log(a);
       }
       y();
   }
   x();

    if we set debugger on 'console.log(a);' ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 
        Closure (x) üîΩ  
            a: 7
    it means function y() is executing(accesing) lexical variable of function x() and this bundling of two function is known as closure.


Exmaple üëâ
   function x(){
       var a = 7;
       function y(){
           console.log(a);
       }
       return y;
   }
   var z = x();
    console.log(z); // this will print enitre body of functionn y.
    z(); // this will print the value of 'a' which is 7.
